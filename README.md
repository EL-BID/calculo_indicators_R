## Welcome to IDB Social Indicators

This repository aims to provide a framework for computing social sector indicators in a clean, organized and repeatable manner. 

## Getting Started

To start contributing, first clone this repository. Then, we primarily work with two branches: 1) `main` and 2) `development`.

The `development` branch is the most current one. When contributing, pull from this branch and create a new personal branch for the specific task you are working on. For instance, if you are reviewing geographical disaggregations, create a branch named "geographic_dis_scl".

Work on the assigned tasks, commit and push the changes to the `development` branch. Make a pull request so that another team member can review it and accept it as the new version of `development`.

## Calculating indicators

To calculate indicators, create the folder Outputs and then there are two ways to calculate indicators depending on the amount of countries and years required:
1. **Specific country, source of information and year**: Open the `runningScript.R`, and modify the variables *pais*, *year*, *type* and *geoLevel* after which execute the code `runningScript.R`.
   - *pais*: To specify this use the ISO Alpha-3 code for the specific country (e.g. SLV for El Salvador).
   - *year*: Specify as a string the required year for the indicator
   - *tipo*: Specify one of the two:"censos" or "encuestas" as strings depending if census or surveys are required. 
   - *geoLevel1*: For census, specify if the indicators to calculate will be disagregated at a country level or first geographical disagreggation. 

3. **Loop through different countries and years**: Open the `runningScript.R` and define the variable tipo with "encuestas" or "censos" depending on the data source type required. Then execute the code `runningScript_loop.R` and indicators will be calculated based on all the census or surveys available according to the `Inputs/running_survey.csv` or `Inputs/running_census.csv` files. 


## Repository Structure 

This repository consists of three main parts.

1. **Intermediate Variables**: One script per division, each containing all necessary variables for computing the indicators of the corresponding division (`var_EDU.R`, `var_GDI.R`, `var_LMK.R` and `var_SOC.R`)

3. **Indicator Definitions (`idef.csv`)**: This file controls the computation of indicators. It contains the definition of each indicator.


4. **Running Scripts**: `runningScript.R` runs the function in `scl_indicators.R`. `runningScript_loop.R` runs `scl_indicators.R` for a batch of countries


5. **Functions**: These scripts stablish the functions required to calculate indicators.
   - `functions.R`: contains the functions to calculate indicators for ratios (scl_pct), means (scl_mean) and gini (scl_gini). As well as a function to execute all indicators in `idef.csv` (calculate_indicators) and a function to delimit the disagregations to execute (evaluatingFilter). 
   - `directory_periods.R`: This scrips based on the type of data source survey (encuesta) or census(censos) defined in variable *tipo* returns the appropiate harmonized.
  
6. **Inputs folder** This folder includes important supporting documents such as excels showing the data available (Planeación - Armonización de Encuestas de Hogares.xlsx, Planeación - Population and Housing Censuses.xlsx, running_census.csv and running_survey.csv), dictionary of variable for both census and surveys (D.1.1.4 Diccionario microdatos encuestas de hogares.xlsx and D.7.1.3 Diccionario variables censos.xlsx) and identification files (idef.csv and idefCensos.csv) defining the indicators to calculate.
